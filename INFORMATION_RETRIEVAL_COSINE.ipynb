            "['One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you ll be hooked. They are right as this is exactly what happened with me. br br The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word GO. Trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence. Its is hardcore in the classic use of the word. br br It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans Muslims gangstas Latinos Christians Italians Irish and more....so scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away. br br I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn t dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romance...OZ doesn t mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal I couldn t say I was ready for it but as I watched more I developed a taste for Oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence but injustice crooked guards who ll be sold out for a nickel inmates who ll kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience Watching Oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.', 'A wonderful little production. br br The filming technique is very unassuming very old time BBC fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece. br br The actors are extremely well chosen Michael Sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master s of comedy and his life. br br The realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with Halliwell s murals decorating every surface are terribly well done.', 'I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer . While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2 Risk Addiction I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love. br br This was the most I d laughed at one of Woody s comedies in years dare I say a decade . While I ve never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman. br br This may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than Devil Wears Prada and more interesting than Superman a great comedy to go see with friends.', 'Basically there s a family where a little boy Jake thinks there s a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the time. br br This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. br br OK first of all when you re going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots. br br 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake just ignore them.', 'Petter Mattei s Love in the Time of Money is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. br br This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler s play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat. br br The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter. br br The acting is good under Mr. Mattei s direction. Steve Buscemi Rosario Dawson Carol Kane Michael Imperioli Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive. br br We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.', 'Probably my all time favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but it s not preachy or boring. It just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and Bette Davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight. The kids are as grandma says more like dressed up midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the mother s slow awakening to what s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs they d all be up for this movie.', 'I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero s every week.You have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.We need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventure.Oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many movies.So any ole way I believe I ve got what I wanna say.Would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit If this is so then I must go so lets do it.', 'This show was an amazing fresh innovative idea in the 70 s when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that. By 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and it s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today. br br It s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts this show probably wouldn t still be on the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success. As it is now the show is just awful. I can t believe it s still on the air.', 'Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I ve seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them it s awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the film s only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times . The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. br br The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1 score is Harvey Keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.', 'If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. If you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it. br br Great Camp', 'Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines. br br At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I didn t find the jokes or oddness funny anymore. br br Its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually I just lost interest. br br I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking. br br For something similar but better try Brother from another planet', 'I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror. br br As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn t care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the unintentional humor. br br But about a year or so later I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star Janet Leigh was bumped off early in the film. I sat up and took notice at that point. Since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well worn formula. There are no rules.', 'So im not a big fan of Boll s work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal maybe im the only one . Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. br br People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. br br Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how he s not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a .. br br However the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier making Genetically Mutated soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of SPOILER Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods. We haven t even gone FAR before I started to CRY mehehe I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience meaning most of it will suck. br br There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse that s poop for you simpletons from a fa r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he s on screen.', 'The cast played Shakespeare. br br Shakespeare lost. br br I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses but why ruin something so good. br br Is it because The Scottish Play is my favorite Shakespeare I do not know. What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler hence bowdlerization tried to do something similar in the Victorian era. br br In other words you cannot improve perfection. br br I have no more to write but as I have to write at least ten lines of text and English composition was never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it.', 'This a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. One of the actors is george clooney and I m not a fan but this roll is not bad. Another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack The man of constant sorrow . I recommand this movie to everybody. Greetings Bart', 'Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I ve ever seen. Sort of like a high school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town Pretty hard to get involved with this one. No lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsense....What was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters. And what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles Give this one a pass it s like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa.....', 'Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of Owen Wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.', 'This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. Horrible. br br There wasn t a continuous minute where there wasn t a fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them br br Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies LOTR Star Wars and Matrix. br br Examples br br The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda Obee One and Vader. br br The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. Elijah Wood is the victim in both films and wait......it hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello br br And the whole machine vs. humans theme WAS the Matrix..or Terminator..... br br There are more examples but why waste the time And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi s Nazi s br br There was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children s movie or an adult movie and wasn t much of either. br br Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.', 'I remember this film it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74 75 my Dad took me my brother sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England. I recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me know.The cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.', 'An awful film It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They ve taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they ve taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine. But it s simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script I suppose there weren t enough naked people in the factual version. It s hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist s life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they d favored the rest of the film with same brevity.', 'After the success of Die Hard and it s sequels it s no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of Die Hard on a ..... movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept. That is what they did with Cliffhanger Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly Stop or My Mom Will Shoot Stallone s career. br br Cliffhanger is one big nit pickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing base jumping aviation facial expressions acting skills. All in all it s full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out acted by a horse However if you an forget all the nonsense it s actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughs. br br You ve got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent Rex Linn as Travers. br br He may of been Henry in Portrait of a Serial Killer but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe worthy performance as Hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody And whilst he surely can t be it really does look like Ralph Waite s Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death. br br Mention too must go to former London s Burning actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football yes you can t help enjoy that bit Hal needed a good kicking. br br So forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy And if you re looking for Qaulen he s the one wearing the helicopter.', 'I had the terrible misfortune of having to view this b movie in it s entirety. br br All I have to say is save your time and money This has got to be the worst b movie of all time it shouldn t even be called a b movie more like an f movie Because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie the story is not interesting at all all of the actors are paper thin and not at all believable it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it s almost funny.......almost. br br The movie is just packed full of crappy one liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit. br br This movie is supposed to be geared towards men but all the women in it are SO utterly unattractive especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end. They try to appear sexy in those weird horrible costumes and they fail miserably br br Even some of the most ridiculous b movies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch', 'What an absolutely stunning movie if you have 2.5 hrs to kill watch it you won t regret it it s too much fun Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn t anything more other than him I still liked it. The music by A.R.Rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it.', 'First of all let s get a few things straight here a I AM an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool . b I DO like several B Movies because they re hilarious. c I like the Godzilla movies a lot. br br Moving on when the movie first comes on it seems like it s going to be your usual B movie down to the crappy FX but all a sudden BOOM the anime comes on This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill. br br The animation is VERY bad cheap even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER for crissakes In fact it s so cheap one of the few scenes from the movie I vividly remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... it s the same kids over over again The FX are terrible too the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition the transition to live action to animation is unorganized the dialogue voices especially the English dub that I viewed was horrid I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD VHS player The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes comments like the robots Joel Mike on MST3K you pick the season . Honestly this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie survive it at the same time. br br Heck I m planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B Movie night. Because it s stupid pretty painful to watch unintentionally hilarious at the same time I m giving this movie a 3 10 an improvement from the 0.5 10 I was originally going to give it. br br According to my grading scale 3 10 means Pretty much both boring bad. As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15.', 'This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film. It s great to see J.Beals but she s only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie revolving about an actor who can t get work doesn t feel very original to me. Nor does the development of the cop. It feels like one of many straight to video movies I saw back in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards. br br', 'The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter s complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts and details. br br Cynthia Gibb portrays Karen was not a fine election. She is a good actress but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. br br Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific she does a great job as Karen s mother. br br It has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately they weren t though this movie was on the top of the ratings in USA and other several countries', 'The Cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date. br br I ve read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. The Cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don t want any more Personally I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge him. br br We ve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes I do agree that the genre is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed. But The Cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied. br br I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. Instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. The Cell wants to let you see what it s all about and not how it s all about and I guess that s what some people don t like. True I do like explanations with my movies but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in. br br I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn t be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like. If it were up to me it d at least get nominated for best picture. br br I ve noticed that I ve kind of been repeating myself. Not because there s nothing else to say but because I can t stress enough how fantastic I thought The Cell was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy . I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater I heard one audience member say Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs. If so I want what he was smoking. br br out of 4', 'This film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire Hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end. br br Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR INC. it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular film. br br There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war. But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern.', 'This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I d be able to stand it. But I was wrong. First the weird looping It was like watching America s Funniest Home Videos . The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo typical Latino family I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone I just hated her and had to mention it. Now the final scene transcends I must say. It s so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. What crappy dancing. Horrible and beautiful at once.', 'War movie is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clich d dialogue rehashed plot and over the top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large scale combat. Once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War era Cold Mountain starring Jude Law Nicole Kidman and Ren e Zellweger is such a film. br br Then again calling Cold Mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough the film opens with a quite literally quick and dirty battle sequence that puts Glory director Edward Zwick shame. However Cold Mountain is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman played by Jude Law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind Ada Monroe played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier s tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived. br br Cold Mountain soon takes a drastic turn though as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile back at the farm Ada s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada s rescue is the course tough as nails Ruby Thewes played by Ren e Zellweger who helps Ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada. br br Within these two settings a vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the war torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby s deadbeat father Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by the war of Northern aggression mostly for the worse. The dark pervading anti war message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century it s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant. br br Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot. br br Make no mistake Cold Mountain has neither the traits of a feel good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.', 'Taut and organically gripping Edward Dmytryk s Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle. br br Bivouacked in Washington DC a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up at a stranger s apartment where Robert Ryan drunk and belligerent beats their host Sam Levene to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum who s assigned to Ryan s outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three George Cooper who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy Steve Brodie to insure his silence before Young closes in. br br Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan naturally does his prototypical Angry White Male and to the hilt while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance his role however is not central Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fully fledged rendition of the smart mouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack who s leeched into her life Paul Kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorable. br br The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but it s pretty much confined to Young s reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit . At least there s no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why Ryan hates Jews and hillbillies and... . br br Curiously Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it the novel it s based on Richard Brooks The Brick Foxhole dealt with a gay bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti Semitism the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer . br br But while the change from homophobia to anti Semitism works in general the specifics don t fit so smoothly. The victim s chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since there s a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip off to the original engine generating Ryan s murderous rage.', 'Ardh Satya is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India. br br The film tells the Real life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment. br br Amongst various Police officers colleagues the film describes the story of Anand Velankar a young hot blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father s ideologies incidences of his father s Atrocities on his mother. Anand s approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired Job satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholic. br br The Spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro where the Police Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended. br br The Direction is a master piece thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty s house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes the film has Hair raising moments. br br The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism Corruption Political Influence Courage Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly. br br Finally the films belongs to the One man show Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.', 'My first exposure to the Templarios not a good one. I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video which has brought us other cult classics such as Spider Baby . The print quality is excellent but this alone can t hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. There s a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling. Adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket.', 'One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middle man Titta Di Girolamo a physically non descript middle aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we re introduced to him at the start of the film he s been living a non life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo s cash tell him that 10 000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says you can t bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth. Having eventually done this bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo s troubles. br br This initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who won t even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non life Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous . The first half of the film may be described as slow by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo s days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out . br br Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell Amore or L Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist s insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist and in a far more explicit way the Al Pacino film Insomnia Le Conseguenze dell Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that s been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious it s almost impossible to pin point its cause if indeed there is one . br br The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia played by Olivia Magnani grand daughter of the legendary Anna and the memory of Titta s best friend a man whom he hasn t seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again. Though it s never explicitly spelt out the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator s expectations Le Conseguenze dell Amore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecitt during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino like fare more La Vita Bella style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell Amore L Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss world.', 'I watched this film not really expecting much I got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect and you know what I was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer i.e damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious I had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they don t half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot I thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and I haven t even mentioned the killer I m not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I m concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London who was actually quite funny it wasn t because of their acting talent I ve certainly seen a lot worse but I ve also seen a lot better. Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry.', 'I bought this film at Blockbuster for 3.00 because it sounded interesting a bit Ranma esque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a mini skirt on the back and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it. I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. I was 100 wrong. br br Having watched it I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity Honestly I don t usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what she s wearing a miniskirt of some sort . Even the anti religious humor is tame and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightest it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show . This would barely qualify as PG 13 it is Not Rated but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this as if it was pornographic. Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse. br br It is but not in that way. br br In a way this worries me the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides not this one but better ones like The Virgin Suicides it s teenagers. If both of those movies were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect then I have little chance of turning a story I ve been writing into a PG 13 movie the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve . Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers I think it s number 2 so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it. br br Just say no to this movie though. 2 10.', 'The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer get caught. That s it. But before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how bad these actors are including Hopper. I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just don t watch the movie. I ve warned you.', 'Ever watched a movie that lost the plot Well this didn t even really have one to begin with. br br Where to begin The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms that are strangely never actually heard in the house great double glazing The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20 killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house Or the bizarre ritual with the salt pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction. br br Add a lead actress who can t act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty but not in the way you hope. br br Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80 s mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offers nothing but curiosity value and one classic daft murder don t worry its telegraphed at least ten minutes before . br br After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. What do they do Slide down and run like the rest of us No of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon. br br It really IS only a movie as they say..', 'Okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again Week in week out David Morse s character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle but what s wrong with that David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by David Koepp a great writer is heaven br br Due to the lack of love for this show by many I can t see it going to a season series but you never know The amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me let s hope something good can make it past a first series', 'After sitting through this pile of dung my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves disappointingly that it s the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there s also a bonus side plot of misogyny with Dr. Whatever Her Name Was being chided by all involved for never shutting up. She s clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a Dr. title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point Cage s character says Don t you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she s a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it s so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it. The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy....', 'It had all the clich s of movies of this type and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good however the script and acting were B movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. The good actors didn t hold their own nor did they lift up the others. br br This movie is not worthy of more words but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. br br If you are looking for mindless entertainment I still wouldn t recommend this movie.', 'This movie is based on the book A Many Splendored Thing by Han Suyin and tackles issues of race relations between Asians and Whites a topic that comes from Han s personal experiences as an Eurasian growing up in China. That background and the beautiful Hong Kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time. br br Other than that the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined. br br The cinematography really brings out fifty s Hong Kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The ending is a real tear jerker. Some may consider sentimental romances pass but for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories this is a shining example.', 'Of all the films I have seen this one The Rage has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction LOGIC continuity changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain. How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy Gary Busey is know for his B movies but this is a sure W movie. W waste . br br Take for example about two dozen FBI local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is confused as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough. Truly a miracle not since the six shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.', 'I had heard good things about States of Grace and came in with an open mind. I thought that God s Army was okay and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting and I thought well maybe it will get better. Unfortunately it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders Mormon missionaries and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughable. br br Dutcher s only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity. br br The conclusion which I m assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable c mon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy. Next time Dutcher try making a movie that SOMEONE can identify with.', 'This movie struck home for me. Being 29 I remember the 80 s and my father working in a factory. I figured if I worked hard too if I had pride and never gave up I too could have the American Dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own. I ve noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you can t get anywhere. br br I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. it s made for TV and I just saw it an hour ago. Ic an t find it anywhere I d love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time Americans WOULD work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished I think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas...', 'As a disclaimer I ve seen the movie 5 6 times in the last 15 years and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn t in the musical however it tainted me when I watched the musical br br I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role along with Kasey. I think her Let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course . The decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered. br br The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical', 'Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie s charm just doesn t save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don t go out of your way to see this film.', 'How this film could be classified as Drama I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen I would be trying to erase this from my CV. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses got melded into Noah. Lot Abraham s nephew Lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born. Canaanites wandered the earth...really What were the scriptwriters thinking Was it just ignorance I remember something about Noah and animals and Lot and Canaanites and all that stuff from Sunday School or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from Christians Jews and Muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists ...as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended Anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one', 'Preston Sturgis THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael s THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site Kael overstated her case. br br There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane the newsreel representing Ralston the Henry Luce clone Thatcher s memoirs Bernstein Jed Leland Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane s story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re tellings of the same incident. br br This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes like KANE it is about a legendary business leader here it is Tom Garner Spencer Tracy a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators they are Garner s right hand man Henry Ralph Morgan and his wife Sarah Padden . This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry when he narrates is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public she sees only the flaws in Henry. br br Typical example Although he worked his way up Tom becomes more and more anti labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom s confrontation with the Union in a major walk out and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry s wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike apparently blowing up the Union s headquarters killing many people . So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black. br br I m not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE s success few films do including all of Orson Welles other films but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one s interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home. br br When they marry Tom wants to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire he expands it and improves it constantly . But it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve Helen Vinson the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her. br br Similarly Tom too gets a full shock which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry . Eve marries Tom and presents him with a son but it turns out to be Eve s son by Tom s son Tom Jr. Philip Trent . The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself. br br The film is not a total success the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans . Sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.', 'Average and surprisingly tame Fulci giallo which means it s still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid build up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance. br br The genre s well known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points. And the finale goes on much too long while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say limp affair. br br Fulci s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing though. Yellow clues wherever you look. br br 3 out of 10 limping killers', 'Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood and the protagonist Gordon Liu the counterpart to the western s Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest this is Presented in Shaw Scope just like the good old days. br br This film is a simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era. br br Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters. They can t do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times. br br Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods kinda like Mr Miyagi s style in Karate Kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kung fu the unorthodox way. br br Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects each obvious non contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slow motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad nausem in Hollywood flicks they sure don t make fight scenes like they used to Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday so if you re game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for', 'SPOILERS All too in real life as well as in the movies familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun or rifle in their hands.

Of course it s not going to be an Oscar nominated film it s just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes. br br The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. It s just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes a lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience. br br I d give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that only. Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment something to pass time if you re bored and nothing else. br br 4 10', 'I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It s so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens The office manager comes outside and offers her a job Hilarious Next thing you know the two women are going at it. Yep they re lesbians Nothing rings true in this Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do movie. Clunky dialogue like I don t want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didn t take it doesn t help. There s a wealthy distant mother who disapproves of her daughter s new relationship. A sassy black maid unbelievable that in the year 2003 a film gets made in which there s a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh No cliche is left unturned.', 'NO SPOILERS br br After Hitchcock s successful first American film Rebecca based upon Daphne DuMarier s lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period mistaken identity and espionage. As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale war effort of civilians building planes weaponry and other necessary militia the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption war time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC who co authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock s sensibilities. br br This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane Robert Cummings who while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory meets new employee Frank Frye Norman Lloydd and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who don t believe his far fetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful freaks and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin Priscilla Lane who during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security he falls madly in love with Of course in the land of Hitchcock Patricia kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix. br br In good form for this outing Hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies average Joes and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. It s a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited culminates in one of Hitchcock s more memorable finales. Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the war time shooting ban on public attractions . While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock s most well known films it s a popular b movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual terrific Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock s cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. Hitchcock s original cameo idea that was shot him fighting in sign language with his deaf wife was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf', 'I just watched The Dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago. br br It s not a big movie and doesn t try to make a big splash but my God the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie. br br The Dresser is the story of Sir an aging Shakespearean actor Finney and his dresser Norman Courtenay sort of a valet putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men each dependent upon the other Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir without Sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway. br br This is a character driven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they re taking their bows And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use though. For although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple. br br Yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are Finney Courtenay and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there aren t other fine performances most notably Eileen Atkins as the long suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been. br br Although it doesn t get talked about these days it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay Best Picture Best Director Peter Yates and Best Adapted Screenplay. br br I had remembered this as being a good movie but I wasn t prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then I encourage you to see The Dresser.', 'What happened What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually it never really got going. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it. Steve Martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters Kate and Angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot.', 'I ve just watched Fingersmith and I m stunned to see the 8 10 average rating for the show. br br Not only was the plot was difficult to follow but it seems character development was randomly applied. br br The actors were adequate but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional. Once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tedious. br br And just in case anyone didn t see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film. br br The end scene is disappointing and phoned in and anyone who sat back and went Ohhh so they were carpet munchers all along must have been out for the evening. br br Two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it...', 'So let s begin br br The movie itself is as original as Cronenberg s movies would usually appear... br br My intention to see it was certainly JJL being one of my favourite actresses. She is as lovely as usual this cutie br br I would not say it was my favourite movie of hers. Still it s quite interesting and entertaining to follow. br br The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array. br br Recommend with confidence', 'Besides being boring the scenes were oppressive and dark. The movie tried to portray some kind of moral but fell flat with its message. What were the redeeming qualities On top of that I don t think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did.', 'An unmarried woman named Stella Bette Midler gets pregnant by a wealthy man Stephen Collins . He offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own. Things go OK until the child named Jenny Trini Alvarado becomes a teenager and things gradually and predictably become worse. br br I ve seen both the silent version and sound version of Stella Dallas . Neither one affected me much and I cry easily but they were well made if dated. Trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of Beaches to get this made. This predictably bombed. The story is laughable and dated by today s standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado give good performances this film really drags and I was bored silly by the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason both good actors don t help in supporting roles. Flimsy and dull. Really who thought this would work See the 1937 Stanwyck version instead. I give this a 1.', 'DON T TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci s earlier and honestly in terms of story line better... films and although not the typical bloodbath that Fulci is known for this is still a very unique and enjoyable film. br br The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both include the towns police force a small time reporter a beautiful and rich ex drug addict a young priest and his mother An old man who practices witchcraft and his female prot g a mentally handicapped townsman and a deaf mute little girl. All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed... br br DON T TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a classical giallo or a typical Fulci gore film. Although it does contain elements of both it is more of an old fashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulci s later works . This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. Recommended for giallo murder mystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of Fulci s non splatter films but don t despair DON T TORTURE still has more than it s fair share of violence and sleaze. Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting but if that type of material doesn t bother you then definitely give this one a look. 8.5 10', 'Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays PVC clad bad ass bitch Alexandra the faithful acolyte of Faust an evil entity trapped in hell. Determined to free her master the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon Faust the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive troll like creatures called Lite and Dark. br br Now Alexandra must find a replacement gem which isn t going to be easy the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex lover police detective Jonathan Graves Peter Liapis who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile wise cracking inter dimensional half pints Lite and Dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home. br br In the warped movie world of Jim Wynorski all females are big breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker. Ghoulies IV is no exception every woman in this film whether she be a police captain a curator of antiquities or a mental patient in an asylum is hot hot hot and wears not a lot and it s this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of STV crap just about bearable. br br But be warned even though the presence of semi naked quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful the black humour as the DVD blurb describes it is about as funny as a knee to the knackers with the comedic banter of Lite and Dark being particularly cringe worthy and the special effects are bargain basement consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier. br br 3 10 solely for the high bimbo quotient.', 'I really like Salman Kahn so I was really disappointed when I seen this movie. It didn t have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. Salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad it was quite nice. Usually Indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an Indian film. The American actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series Heroes Ali Larter. Her acting had a lot to be desired. However she did look good in the Indian dresses that she wore. All the movie had not a lot to be desired and I hope Salman does a lot better on his next movie. Thank you.', 'I m not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in HP3 he played a totally different character he was eight years older in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren t the most talented and couldn t carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies. I m sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinked into thinking that they were seeing a sequel not a totally different film with a familiar name. And I m sorry...Kym Whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris Ketty Lester or DC Curry in the earlier films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN Just naming the film Down to the Last Minute would have been OK. Furthermore the Hudlin brothers who produced the first three movies were not involved in the making of this film.', 'This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook How to write a space disaster movie and followed it play by play. In particular the stereo typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space putting on a brave show in the face of disaster has been done time and time again. br br Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw 50 million at the project. But judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only muster 50 thousand. To learn that the film was nominated for a Special Visual Effects Emmy has me absolutely gob smacked. br br I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more believable effects br br And the plot holes are too numerous to mention. But I will pick one out as an example. Now I m no NASA expert but surely it s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear shaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twenty nine year old who has not been in the control room before. br br The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script. br br I give this film 2 out of 10 with the above average work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.', 'Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original Henry Wilcoxon for example except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt being played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the originals humor especially the scene at his office I don t go in for law suits or motions. I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f ing baseball bat make a bonfire with the chippindale maybe roast that golden retriever arff arff arff then eat it. And then I m comin upstairs junior and I m grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a Do we have an understanding . Offsetting his small role however is Dan Acroyd who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny its just stupid. Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.', 'Honestly this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven t made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some creepiness factor to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull . This is an expensive beautifully filmed turd. It s not that shocking it s not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos the filming is good and it does have some gore if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore... but other than that absolutely nothing going for this over hyped mess. On the other hand GENESIS Cerda s sequel to AFTERMATH now available as a double feature released by Unearthed films is an absolute masterpiece of a short film really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material. Although I don t care for AFTERMATH at all GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and Definitely keep an eye out for him in the future...', 'I thought that Mukhsin has been wonderfully written. Its not just about entertainment. There s tonnes of subtle messages that i think Yasmin was trying to bring across. And yes it might be confusing to some of you especially if you didn t watch Sepet and or Gubra for 76 times . br br I bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right Its really ironic how the characters relate. Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from Gubra. And the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. br br And i absolutely love the voice overs. Its crude yet awakeningly fresh. Like when they took a shot of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin signboard then there was suddenly Mukhsin s voice saying Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim.. the scene when he climbed the tree . br br It captured Malaysian s attitude and in some mild way sniggering at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character. For example even the kids can be really sharp tongued complete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. And how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl when ur own life isn t sorted out. br br All i can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it. br br It kept me glued to the screen i couldn t even take my eyes off it. Not even to make out in the cinema. Ha ha.', 'I am not a golf fan by any means. On May 26 about 10 30 PM the movie started with a scene in the late 1800 s. Old movies I like but not golf however within the first scene a young boy Harry Vardon is awaken by the voices of men. He goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... So then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. The movie is excellent. We then see this young boy now a man professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. Then we meet the true focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in Francis winning. Don t want to give away too much . I was up until 2 A.M. This is super please see the movie.', 'Upon viewing Tobe Hooper s gem Crocodile in 2000 I developed a great interest in the college crocodile niche of the exploitation monster genre. I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer all we d need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants. br br While Tobe Hooper s crocky opus referenced his own movies Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions homages rip offs to Jaws Temple of Doom Indiana Jones Last Crusade The Convent Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie. Also try to find the ready for tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock. br br I was disappointed the crock didn t get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism...or crocky appreciation but the quasi Captain Ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach. Perhaps in the coming years we ll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset. Or hopefully a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero G monkey midget crocodile bloodshed. br br All in all the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me.', 'It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Sh Kasugi Christopher Lee and John Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B adventure of all time. It s actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with it s flaws captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it s made in the 90s it doesn t have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand just has the real feeling. You just can t hate it. I think it s an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack.

Turns out it s way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever. There s a problem and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies And with the killing scenes there has to be at least a little tack and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity in creating the creature killer whatever. Entrails of a Virgin has neither. It s safe to say it s a pretty soulless movie even if isn t one of the very worst ever made it s there just for horn dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their other heads. br br In this case we re given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too salacious and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by A Murderer as he s credited. First off the director Kazuo Gaira Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or phoned in take your pick clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. It looks like it s from another movie. Then once settled into the house there s a wrestling scene that s poorly choreographed and shot yeah we really need to see him all there and then on to the rape and killings. First the rape by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time. Then the Murderer who like D Amato s creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men and or rapes the women one by one. br br Now the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie. This is like saying however that the cro tons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. An eye gouging scene a spike thrown like an Olympic event that scene actually is kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sex crazed girl whose inconsequential name I can t remember. Even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title On top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through Gaira and his indulgence in long takes without cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway are dubbed over by the actors you d think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves . But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one where it s just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him You just want it to be done with for the I hate women mantra to ease up or be rid altogether.', 'The few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes. When Sharif or please God Palance try their hand at fiery oratory they sound like Kurtz swallowing a bug. The displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean and a positively Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came to pass. What does that leave us with One comical dentistry scene a surfeit of uppity Hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train and just for kicks a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to Castro s manic and unremitting cigar fellatio. Never trust a Medved but even a busted clock is right twice a day this is a HISTORICALLY awful movie.', 'This film took me by surprise. I make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler.

I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker Mike Mina s son Doug was going to take us. As a matter of fact I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this br br Life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. Absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must see even if you aren t a fan of the documentary genre. This film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. 51 Birch Street is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience eventually millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. BRAVO', 'Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel dumb. But it s a great movie. Not highly entertaining but very very intriguing. The movie centers around wheelchair bound Stephen Hawkings a man who makes Einstein look average and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe time the galaxy and black holes. Everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they ll write it all down. Well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours. Here is a man who despite suffering from Lou Gehrig s disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen.

As the story unfolds in real life and fiction Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end. br br The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea he just didn t know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful. br br Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he s still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can t get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what s actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that s titled The Number 23 is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it s horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished. br br The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn t even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. Rating 3 10', 'We brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play. The film is barely watchable and the acting is dire. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable. br br Just terrible', 'This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous And i have never seen such bad acting in my life The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially Drew Fuller . I don t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie I didn t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves. I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch I was very disappointed The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion.', 'This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. I wouldn t call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end. If you don t want to know much about the plot don t keep reading. br br Gilbert s character Ophelia is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. Brad Johnson also an excellent actor is Matt who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle convincing and compelling in this role. br br The two meet on the beach through her daughter Pip and initially Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. br br The chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. Two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy a secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together. I wish there was more to it than that but there it is in a nutshell. br br I wanted mindless entertainment and I got it with this. In regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable. A Secret Affair with Janine Turner is far superior not a Steele book as are some of Steele s earlier books turned into film.', 'Oh noes one of these attack of the Japanese ghost girl movies... i don t even remember how many i ve seen. maybe it sells... but not to me. not scary at all. the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these... also the pulling of the kid. i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies. cellphone scene is also nothing new... the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked... i mean it lacked all dramaticness... OK this is for kids 14 16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique... we ll let me tell you. there s a million of you D this is one of them. 3 10 i ve seen worse but you won t be missing anything by NOT seeing this', 'Nicholas Walker is Paul the local town Reverand who s married to Martha Ally Sheedy but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair Veronica Dara Tomanovich . However in so doing he gets a bout of amnesia hence the name of the film . Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good Reverand in a shades of Misery type of way. It s sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. Not the least bit John Savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a film billed as a black comedy one has to bring BOTH elements into said movie. While this does bring the former in spades it sadly contains none of the latter. Furthermore you can t emphasize with any of the characters and as thus have absolutely no vested interest in them. Technically not an all together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one. br br Eye Candy Dara Tomanovich gets topless Sally Kirkland also shows some skin br br My Grade C br br Where I saw it Showtime Showcase', 'Hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world. It only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re invented over and over again. Take superheroes for example for each X Man and Spiderman there are Daredevil Elektra Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worst. It only took The Ring which was pitch perfect mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky to bring a ton of look alike creepy woman based horrors e.g. The Ring 2 The Eye Dark Water which was fine but pointless and the grudges. br br The first Grudge wasn t entirely bad. It was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it. Plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy Men in Black II Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain For the Grudge 2 the critic goes the same way. br br Tired scares bad acting except for Amber Tamblyn and clich s all over the place. Three stories take place on different places and time. There is Aubrey Tamblyn investigating what drove her sister Karen Sarah Michelle Gellar to death Allison Arielle Kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an American family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. Glad to say and I mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dull. br br The chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldn t enter a house others that dig too deep. Meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey doesn t that seem just like another bad Japanese remake something called Pulse Yeah day after day it s getting easier to hold a grudge... against Hollywood bullshits.', 'Down Periscope has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS. Since then we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now. br br It is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. It is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered. br br The movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession even among the very young. I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile Alabama in 2002. A group of Cub Scouts my grandson among them had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board. br br It is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our Navy and Hollywood... which is rare company. br br Thanks to Kelsey Grammar Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie such great entertainment', 'If you came here it s because you ve already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it. br br I feel for you I really do. And I profusely apologize as a Canadian because that s what we do that this film ever had to cross your eyes if only for a moment. I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases. br br I like everyone else rented this movie believing it to be some stupid B movie ripoff of Blade. I thought sure I could use a good laugh at a stupid movie. I ll give the creators of this film ONE positive comment about their creation Thanks for removing the REC XX XX XX from the bottom right hand corner of the screen. I can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie. br br And for the record I saw the movie but did not watch it. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother s trailer I swear to God. br br You know what I m not writing anymore about this. It s just too painful.', 'Deanna Durbin Nan Grey and Barbara Read are Three Smart Girls in this Universal film from 1936 which introduces Deanna Durbin to film audiences. It also stars Ray Milland Mischa Auer Charles Winninger John King Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It s a sweet story about three young women now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father Winninger is marrying again. Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him they board a ship to America with the help of the housekeeper nanny determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intended called Precious Barnes is nothing but a gold digger aided and abetted by her mother Brady they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count. This is arranged by their father s accountant King . The man he chooses is a full time drunk Auer but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count Milland . What a mess. br br This is a delightful film not cloying or overly sugary at all with some nice performances particularly by Auer Milland Barnes and Brady. The young women are pretty and all do good work. The emphasis of course is on young Durbin who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult she has no trouble with the high notes as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. She sings a delightful Il Bacio in a police station. br br One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father played by Charles Winninger not want his children around until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the gold digger isn t all that young but the girls mother looks way up there so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger more glamorous woman. In fact he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters. br br Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here she has the final shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is. br br Very entertaining and of course this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna.', 'If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England. Other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with Alfred Molina Joan Plowright Polly Walker Josie Lawrence Jim Broadbent Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the major roles. Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter s eye. Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too. An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us.', 'I watched this series out of curiosity wanting to see if they could possibly and with ALL this modern technology out do Cecil B. DeMille s classic epic of 1956 starring Charleton Heston Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course I was let down. Yes they had all the Biblical characters correct but they didn t give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes that held your interest throughout the first movie. If you going to have a mini series you have to have some rivoting scenes the Burning bush Parting the RED Sea drowning Pharohs Armies building Sethi s Pyramids could have been done with todays technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as Lord of the Rings or the Matrix. Obviously they didn t want to leave a LASTING impression of faith and sacrifice which is much needed in these trouble times.', 'Daniel Day Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father an impudent violent butcher in Gangs of New York in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody s in the Pianist and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot just to name a few . His roles all influence eachother but each is seperate and utterly unique. He changes completely with each character he takes on. And I m beginning to believe that he can act as anything. Anything. br br As Cristy Brown he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character and he does not pity the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human. br br This movie despite small scene transition faults and the like is an inspiration. Yes it s predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isn t a Hollywood movie. br br My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen Peter and her friends. Here s where Daniel Day Lewis reaches an acting climax. I ll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that s animated. Wheel out the cripple And his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again again and I never get tired of Cristy s perspicacious eyes twitching and guttural speeches. br br A must see. Fo sho yo', 'My guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts and thus at least a quarter longer because otherwise how can one explain its confused abbreviated storyline. I was never completely lost but I was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. The movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot. br br If it were longer it might make more sense but it still wouldn t be much good. The movie s most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female but the movie drops the ball on this making Hera s followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you don t see the gods and there s no real certainty that they exist. So it s got a couple of intriguing ideas but it doesn t do anything useful with them. br br Bad dialog cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons. Not unwatchable but also not worth watching.', 'Well I like to watch bad horror B Movies cause I think it s interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie. I always compare this movies to for example some Spielberg s works and again and again don t understand the huge difference in what I see. I like Ed Wood s movies cause it s so inept it s very funny. But people The Chilling is not funny and is not even interesting . It s EXTREMELY BORING horror movie without ANYTHING what makes even bad movies watchable. There s no acting no screenplay no direction no thrills and not even blood. It s extremely inept amateurish film. It s definitely the WORST movie I had ever seen and I had seen a lot of worst movies believe me . I warned you 1 10', 'This IS the worst movie I have ever seen as well as the worst that I will probably EVER see. I see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously just be forewarned... br br This IS NOT one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it its just plain BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. br br This movie is the equivalent to having a pet rock as your friend. You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately it never does. At least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. Lion s Gate completely deceives on this bombshell... No...this is a disaster. After watching this film you would swear George W. Bush had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic. br br Stay away unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time. Its probably how Lion s Gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe.', 'I have been a Mario fan for as long as I can remember I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space. br br The story begins much like any other Mario game Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arriving at Peach s castle Mario finds Bowser and his son Bowser Jr. attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space. In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Luma s home a floating space station here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space station s Power Stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach thus the adventure begins. br br The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the Wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games. br br My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak. The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives. Still these minor problems aside it s a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging. This is the type of game that we ve been waiting for on the Wii. br br A perfect 10 out of 10']\n"
